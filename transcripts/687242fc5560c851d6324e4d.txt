[2025-07-12T11:16:27.922Z] AI Agent: We have a variety of options for you to choose from. For breakfast, we have bagel sandwiches like the Original Classic with egg and cheese, or if you prefer something lighter, we have the Avocado Toast, which you've already mentioned. We also have fresh bagels with various spreads, or specialty items like omelette wraps, and breakfast burritos. If you're looking for something sweet, we have muffins, pastries, and cookies. And of course, we have a selection of beverages, including coffee, tea, and fresh-squeezed orange juice. What sounds good to you?

[2025-07-12T11:16:27.982Z] Customer: One one second. One second. And, breakfast, avocado beer, the sandwich. I think one second, please. Hold on.

[2025-07-12T11:16:27.983Z] AI Agent: I think there might have been a misunderstanding. You initially ordered the Avocado Toast, and then you customized it with a French Toast bagel, lightly toasted, and extra cheese. You didn't order a breakfast sandwich. Would you like to add a breakfast sandwich to your order or keep it as is?

[2025-07-12T11:16:27.983Z] Customer: No. Right now, I want avocado BLT sandwich, French toast bagel, and, extra cheese.

Now, before I place this order, do you have any special requests or allergies I should note for the kitchen?
