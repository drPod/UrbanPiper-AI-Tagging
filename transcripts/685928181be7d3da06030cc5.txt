[2025-06-23T10:12:30.724Z] AI Agent: Hello Gaurav, welcome to Manhattan Bagel. It's great to see you again. What would you like to order?

[2025-06-23T10:12:30.725Z] Customer: Request bundle.

[2025-06-23T10:12:30.725Z] AI Agent: The Breakfast Bundle is perfect for a group. It comes with thirteen bagels, two tubs of cream cheese, four muffins, and a box of coffee. Let me get all the customization options for you...

[2025-06-23T10:12:30.725Z] AI Agent: Alright, I have all the options for you. Do you want to proceed with the customization now?

[2025-06-23T10:12:30.725Z] Customer: Yes.

[2025-06-23T10:12:30.726Z] AI Agent: First, for the **thirteen bagels** in your Bagel Dozen. Popular choices are Plain, Everything, or Sesame. What would you like for those? You can choose a variety if you'd like.

[2025-06-23T10:12:30.726Z] Customer: Okay. I all, I want all of as scallion bagel.

[2025-06-23T10:12:30.726Z] AI Agent: Scallion bagels for all thirteen. Next, for your **two tubs of spread**. We have Plain, Vegetable, or Scallion. Want to hear more options?

[2025-06-23T10:12:30.726Z] Customer: So in your bagel type, do you have Charlene bagel?

[2025-06-23T10:12:30.726Z] AI Agent: We have Scallion/Onion Chive, which is similar to what you're looking for. Would you like to choose that as one of your spreads?

[2025-06-23T10:12:30.726Z] Customer: No. No. I'm asking about the bagel type.

[2025-06-23T10:12:30.726Z] AI Agent: We do have a Scallion bagel type, it's listed as "Scallion/Onion Chive" in our options. Would you like to choose that for your thirteen bagels?

[2025-06-23T10:12:30.727Z] Customer: But I think that is your your tub of spread, not the bagel type. Right?

[2025-06-23T10:12:30.727Z] AI Agent: You are correct, Scallion/Onion Chive is a type of spread, not a bagel type. Let me check the bagel options again. We actually have a "Scallion" bagel type, which is a different option from the spread. Would you like to choose Scallion bagels for your thirteen bagels?
