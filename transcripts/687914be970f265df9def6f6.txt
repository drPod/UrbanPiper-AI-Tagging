[2025-07-17T15:26:41.626Z] AI Agent: Hello there, Welcome to Manhattan Bagel, I'm BagelBot an AI Assistant, and How can I assist you today?

[2025-07-17T15:26:41.626Z] Customer: Hi there. And what where where are you? What's your address?

[2025-07-17T15:26:41.626Z] AI Agent: We're located at 1350 Galloping Hill Rd, Union, NJ 07083, USA. We're open 7 days a week, from 6:00 AM to 3:00 PM. What can I get for you today?

[2025-07-17T15:26:41.626Z] Customer: Yeah. What time do you close that tomorrow?

[2025-07-17T15:26:41.626Z] AI Agent: We close at 3:00 PM tomorrow. Just a heads up, we have a cut-off time for placing new orders at 2:45 PM, which is 15 minutes before closing. Would you like to place an order or inquire about something else?

[2025-07-17T15:26:41.627Z] Customer: Yeah. I'd love to place an order.

[2025-07-17T15:26:41.627Z] AI Agent: What would you like to order today? We have a variety of bagels, sandwiches, and other items on our menu.

[2025-07-17T15:26:41.627Z] Customer: Can you tell me do you have any chicken tenders?

[2025-07-17T15:26:41.627Z] AI Agent: We have several chicken options. One popular item is our Grilled Chicken Club, which comes with grilled chicken, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayo on a bagel. We also have a Chicken Cheese Steak sandwich with grilled chicken, roasted peppers, grilled onions, and cheese on a hero roll. And for our lunch items, we have a Grilled Chicken Wrap with grilled chicken, lettuce, tomato, and Caesar dressing in a flour tortilla. Which one of these sounds good to you?

[2025-07-17T15:26:41.628Z] Customer: I don't actually like any of them. I just want plain chicken tenders and some chips.

[2025-07-17T15:26:41.628Z] AI Agent: We don't have plain chicken tenders as a standalone item on our menu, but I can offer you a side of chicken tenders as part of our catering options or possibly as an add-on to one of our meals. However, I want to let you know that our menu is primarily focused on bagels, sandwiches, and breakfast items. If you're looking for chicken tenders, I can suggest some alternatives that might interest you, such as our Grilled Chicken Club or Chicken Cheese Steak, which I mentioned earlier. Alternatively, if you're set on having chicken tenders, I can offer to add some to a meal, but it would be as part of a larger item. Would you like me to explore some options for you?

What type of bagel or bread would you like? We have everything from plain to sesame to whole wheat, and even some specialty bagels like cinnamon raisin or blueberry.

[2025-07-17T15:26:41.628Z] Customer: Can I just add a plain bagel?

[2025-07-17T15:26:41.628Z] AI Agent: That would be our Single Bagel. I'll add that for you. Would you like it toasted, lightly toasted, or not toasted at all? And would you like any cream cheese or butter on it?

[2025-07-17T15:26:41.629Z] Customer: I wanna toast it.

[2025-07-17T15:26:41.629Z] AI Agent: So, you'd like a plain bagel, toasted. I'll add that for you. Now, would you like to add any spread, such as cream cheese or butter? We have a variety of
