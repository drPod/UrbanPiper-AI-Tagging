[2025-07-17T15:23:50.131Z] AI Agent: Hello there, Welcome to Manhattan Bagel, I'm BagelBot an AI Assistant, and How can I assist you today?

[2025-07-17T15:23:50.132Z] Customer: Moi ton domaine

[2025-07-17T15:23:50.592Z] Unknown: [2025-07-17T15:23:50.132Z] assistant: We have a variety of items on our menu. For breakfast, we have sandwiches like the Original Classic, which comes with egg, cheese, and your choice of meat on a bagel. We also have omelets, pancakes, and French toast. 

If you're looking for something lighter, we have bagels with cream cheese or butter, and a selection of muffins, pastries, and cookies. 

For lunch, we offer a range of sandwiches, including grilled chicken, turkey, and ham, as well as vegetarian options. We also have soups, salads, and wraps. 

And of course, no meal is complete without a drink. We have coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and a variety of juices and sodas. 

What sounds good to you?

[2025-07-17T15:23:50.132Z] Customer: Let's go with a chicken sandwich.

[2025-07-17T15:23:50.592Z] Unknown: [2025-07-17T15:23:50.132Z] assistant: For a chicken sandwich, I have a few options. We have the Grilled Chicken Club, which comes with grilled chicken, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayo on a bagel. We also have the Chicken Cheese Steak, which features grilled chicken, roasted peppers, grilled onions, and cheese on a hero roll. And if you're looking for something a bit different, we have the Spicy Avocado Grilled Chicken, which includes grilled chicken, avocado, pepper jack cheese, and jalapeno cream cheese on a jalapeno bacon roll.

Which of these chicken sandwiches sounds appealing to you?

[2025-07-17T15:23:50.133Z] Customer: For the second one.

[2025-07-17T15:23:50.592Z] Unknown: [2025-07-17T15:23:50.133Z] assistant: The Chicken Cheese Steak is a popular choice. It comes with grilled chicken, roasted peppers, grilled onions, and cheese on a hero roll. 

Now, let's customize it for you. What kind of cheese would you like? I have American, Swiss, Pepper Jack, or Provolone. And would you like it toasted or not toasted?

[2025-07-17T15:23:50.133Z] Customer: Swiss and Notters.

[2025-07-17T15:23:50.133Z] AI Agent: So, you'd like the Chicken Cheese Steak with Swiss cheese and not toasted. Next, would you like to add any vegetables to your sandwich? I have options like lettuce, tomato, spinach, cucumber, and more.

[2025-07-17T15:23:50.134Z] Customer: No. No. Really. No.

[2025-07-17T15:23:50.134Z] AI Agent: So, no additional vegetables for you. Now, let's talk about the side. Would you like to choose a side to go with your Chicken Cheese Steak? I have chips, coleslaw, or you can upgrade to Lays chips for a little extra.

[2025-07-17T15:23:50.134Z] Customer: No.

[2025-07-17T15:23:50.592Z] Unknown: [2025-07-17T15:23:50.134Z] assistant: So, you'd like the Chicken Cheese Steak with Swiss cheese, not toasted, and no additional vegetables, with a side of chips. 

Now, I just need to calculate the total for you. Just a moment... 

Your Chicken Cheese Steak with Swiss cheese, not toasted, and a side of chips comes out to be $10.49. 

Would you like to place your order or make any changes?

[2025-07-17T15:23:50.134Z] Customer: How much is that in British pounds?

[2025-07-17T15:23:50.592Z] Unknown: [2025-07-17T15:23:50.135Z] assistant: I'm happy to help you with the conversion. However, please note that exchange rates can fluctuate, and I might not have the most up-to-date rate. That being said, as of my knowledge cutoff, 1 USD is approximately equal to 0.82 GBP. 

So, if your order is $10.49, that would be roughly Â£8.61. Keep in mind that this is an estimate and might not reflect the current exchange rate. 

Would you like to proceed with your order or make any changes?

[2025-07-17T15:23:50.135Z] Customer: Proceed.

[2025-07-17T15:23:50.592Z] Unknown: [2025-07-17T15:23:50.135Z] assistant: I'll go ahead and place your order for the Chicken Cheese Steak with Swiss cheese, not toasted, and a side of chips. 

Just to confirm, your total comes out to be $10.49. I'll get that ready for you. 

Now, I'll transition you to the next stage to complete your order. Perfect, let me get that all put together for you.
