[2025-07-16T17:27:19.776Z] AI Agent: That would be our Breakfast Bundle on the menu. I'll add that for you. Now I'll help you customize it. You'll need to pick exactly 13 bagels for your bundle. I have Plain, Everything, Sesame, or Blueberry. Want more options?

[2025-07-16T17:27:19.776Z] Customer: Pardon, please?

[2025-07-16T17:27:19.776Z] AI Agent: For the bagels, you can choose from a variety of flavors. Let me start again. I have Plain, Everything, Sesame, or Blueberry. Would you like to choose from these, or would you like me to list more options?

[2025-07-16T17:27:21.612Z] Unknown: [2025-07-16T17:27:19.777Z] assistant: Just a moment... 

For your bagel selection, I have 5 Blueberry, 5 Sesame, 2 Plain, and you mentioned Vanilla. I don't see Vanilla as an option for our bagels, but we do have a Vanilla cream cheese spread. If you're looking for a different bagel flavor, I can offer you Cinnamon Raisin, Chocolate Chip, or Garlic instead. Which one would you like to replace the Vanilla with?

[2025-07-16T17:27:19.777Z] Customer: No. Just just replace with the garlic one then.

[2025-07-16T17:27:19.778Z] AI Agent: I'll replace the Vanilla with Garlic. So, to confirm, you have 5 Blueberry, 5 Sesame, 2 Plain, and 1 Garlic bagel. That's a total of 13

[2025-07-16T17:27:19.778Z] Customer: Beglebot, tell me, which language you can speak. Can you speak in Arabic?

[2025-07-16T17:27:19.778Z] AI Agent: I can speak in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Arabic. If you'd like to continue our conversation in Arabic, I'd be happy to assist you. However, please note that I'll be responding in English for now, as we were already discussing your order. If you'd like to switch to Arabic, just let me know. Now, back to your Breakfast 

[2025-07-16T17:27:19.778Z] Customer: Yeah. Just I want to see, like, how you sound in Arabic. Do can you please sound, me Arabic?

[2025-07-16T17:27:19.778Z] AI Agent: Here's a greeting in Arabic: (Marhaba, ahlan wa sahlan fi Manhattan Bagel. Kayfa omrak yom al-yom?) Which translates to: "Hello, welcome to Manhattan Bagel.

[2025-07-16T17:27:19.778Z] Customer: Okay. And how about in Spanish?

[2025-07-16T17:27:21.612Z] Unknown: [2025-07-16T17:27:19.778Z] assistant: ¡Hola! Bienvenido a Manhattan Bagel. ¿En qué puedo ayudarte hoy? Which means: "Hello! Welcome to Manhattan Bagel. How can I help you today?" 

Now, let's get back to your Breakfast Bundle. You had chosen 5 Blueberry, 5 Sesame, 2 Plain, and 1 Garlic bagel. Next, you need to pick exactly 2 cream cheese tubs. Popular choices are Plain, Vegetable, Scallion, or Strawberry. What would you like?

[2025-07-16T17:27:19.779Z] Customer: I need, one blueberry, one strawberry.

[2025-07-16T17:27:21.612Z] Unknown: [2025-07-16T17:27:19.779Z] assistant: For your cream cheese tubs, I have Blueberry and Strawberry. That sounds like a great combination. 

Next, you can choose up to 4 muffins. We have Blueberry, Corn, Double Chocolate, or Chocolate Chip. Which ones would you like?

[2025-07-16T17:27:19.780Z] Customer: All as con.

[2025-07-16T17:27:21.612Z] Unknown: [2025-07-16T17:27:19.780Z] assistant: You'd like all 4 muffins to be Corn. I've got that noted.

Now, would you like to add a box of coffee to your Breakfast Bundle? We have House Blend, Decaf, Vanilla Hazelnut, or Dark Roast for an extra $24.99.

[2025-07-16T17:27:19.780Z] Customer: Give me that toast.

[2025-07-16T17:27:21.612Z] Unknown: [2025-07-16T17:27:19.780Z] assistant: You'd like to add a box of toast. However, I think you might be referring to a box of coffee, as toast isn't an option for the Breakfast Bundle. If you'd like, I can offer you a box of coffee instead? 

Additionally, I'd like to confirm that you've completed all the customizations for your Breakfast Bundle. You've chosen 5 Blueberry, 5 Sesame, 2 Plain, and 1 Garlic bagel, Blueberry and Strawberry cream cheese, 4 Corn muffins, and you've declined the box of coffee. 

Before I proceed, I just want to confirm that everything looks good to you. Is there anything else you'd like to add or change?

[2025-07-16T17:27:19.780Z] Customer: No. All good. Thank you so much.

[2025-07-16T17:27:19.780Z] AI Agent: You're welcome, Jitin. It was my pleasure to assist you. I'm going to go ahead and finalize your Breakfast Bundle order. Just a moment while I add that up
