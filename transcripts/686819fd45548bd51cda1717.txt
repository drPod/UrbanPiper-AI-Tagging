[2025-07-04T18:17:55.834Z] Customer: Yeah. So so so so so so so why are you asking about the so why are you asking about the American cheese and provolone cheese? Do you see that?

[2025-07-04T18:17:55.834Z] AI Agent: I see that I was incorrectly asking about American cheese and Provolone cheese.

[2025-07-04T18:17:55.834Z] Customer: And why you did that?

[2025-07-04T18:17:55.834Z] AI Agent: I did that because I was not carefully following the menuStructure. I should have only referred to the options listed under mg1409536 and mg1409548. For mg1409536, the option is "Extra Cheese" and for mg1409548, the options are related

[2025-07-04T18:17:55.834Z] Customer: So do you think do you think this menu this menu is not working for you? This menu structure in YAML format, is it complex for you to read out?

[2025-07-04T18:17:55.834Z] AI Agent: I think I can work with the menuStructure in YAML format, but I need to be more careful and accurate in referring to the options and groups listed. It's not that the menu is not working for me, but rather I need to improve my ability to parse and follow the menuStructure correctly. The complexity of the menuStructure is manageable, but I need to make sure I'm referring to the correct groups and options to provide accurate and relevant choices to the user.
