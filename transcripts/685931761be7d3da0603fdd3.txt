[2025-06-23T10:54:57.929Z] AI Agent: Let's start customizing your Breakfast Bundle. For the Bagel Dozen, we have options like Plain, Everything, Asiago, and more. Which thirteen bagels would you like?

[2025-06-23T10:54:57.929Z] AI Agent: I see Scallion here as a cream cheese flavor, but for the bagel types themselves, I have Plain, Everything, or Sesame available. Want to hear the other bagel types I have listed for the bundle?

[2025-06-23T10:54:57.929Z] Customer: No. Can you go with the everything at 13 bagels?

[2025-06-23T10:54:57.929Z] AI Agent: So, you'd like thirteen Everything bagels. Now, let's move on to the Choose 2 Tubs of Spread. We have options like Plain Cream Cheese, Vegetable Cream Cheese, and more. Which two spreads would you like?

[2025-06-23T10:54:57.929Z] Customer: Oh, one line vegetable.

[2025-06-23T10:54:57.930Z] AI Agent: For the Choose 2 Tubs of Spread, I don't see Vanilla as an option, but I do have Plain Cream Cheese and Vegetable Cream Cheese. Would you like to go with those two or hear more options?

[2025-06-23T10:54:57.930Z] Customer: Sorry?

[2025-06-23T10:54:57.930Z] AI Agent: For the Choose 4 Muffins, I see Blueberry and Corn as options, but I don't see Chocolate Dips or Chocolate Chips as exact matches. I do have Double Chocolate as an option, which might be close to what you're looking for. Would you like to go with two Blueberry, two Corn, or try a different combination with the available options?

[2025-06-23T10:54:57.930Z] Customer: So, yeah, except two will be blueberry and two are, chocolate chips chips.

So, I'll go with two Blueberry and two Double Chocolate. Now, let's move on to the Box of Coffee. We have options like House Blend, Decaf, and more. Would you like to add a box of coffee to your bundle?
