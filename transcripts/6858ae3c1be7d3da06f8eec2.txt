[2025-06-23T01:35:35.814Z] AI Agent: Hello Saurabh, welcome to Manhattan Bagel. It's great to see you again. What would you like to order?

[2025-06-23T01:35:35.814Z] Customer: Hey. I just want to order something sweet.

[2025-06-23T01:35:35.814Z] AI Agent: We have a variety of sweet treats to choose from. What kind of sweet treat are you in the mood for? A muffin, pastry, or something else?

[2025-06-23T01:35:35.814Z] Customer: Maybe pastry, or do you have anything sweet with the bagel mixture?

[2025-06-23T01:35:35.814Z] AI Agent: We do have a few sweet options that feature bagels. Let me see what we have. We have a Cinnamon Raisin Bagel, a Blueberry Bagel, or even a French Toast Bagel that might hit the spot. Which one of those sounds good to you?

[2025-06-23T01:35:35.814Z] Customer: Cinnamon bagel, sounds good. How sweet is it? What are the sweetness level in this bagel?

[2025-06-23T01:35:35.814Z] AI Agent: Our Cinnamon Raisin Bagel has a nice balance of sweetness. It's not overly sweet, but it's definitely sweet enough to satisfy your sweet tooth. The sweetness comes from the raisins and a hint of cinnamon sugar on top. I'd say it's a medium level of sweetness, so it's not too overpowering. Would you like to try it with some cream cheese or butter to complement the sweetness?

[2025-06-23T01:35:35.815Z] Customer: Yeah. Yeah. I think a button will be a good option to complement.

[2025-06-23T01:35:35.815Z] AI Agent: Butter sounds like a great choice to go with your Cinnamon Raisin Bagel. Let me just confirm, you'd like to add butter to your Cinnamon Raisin Bagel, right? And would you like

[2025-06-23T01:35:35.816Z] AI Agent: I can definitely ask the kitchen to toast your Cinnamon Raisin Bagel for you. Let me just note that down.

[2025-06-23T01:35:35.816Z] Customer: Yeah. For my wife, I am thinking to order something, crispy, like, you know, so there's something which is crispy and, one of, like, some of your favorite bagels. Like, what do you recommend for vegetarian, especially?

[2025-06-23T01:35:35.816Z] AI Agent: We have a few options that are crispy and vegetarian-friendly. One of our popular choices is the Everything Bagel, it's crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Or if you're looking for something a bit sweeter, our Cinnamon Raisin Bagel is also a great option. We also have a Multigrain Bagel that's a bit crunchier than our other options. Which one of those sounds good to you? Or would you like me to recommend something

[2025-06-23T01:35:35.816Z] Customer: I think multi yeah. Multi grain might might be a better option than if you are saying it's, with with crispy oil. So let's choose multi grain bagel. And, can you can you add avocado, and make it toasted? And, also give me a side of cream cheese, and maybe cheddar cheese is is good for this, this baker?

[2025-06-23T01:35:35.816Z] AI Agent: The Multigrain Bagel is a great choice. I can definitely add avocado to that for you. And yes, I can toast it as well. For the cream cheese, we have a few options that would pair well with the Multigrain Bagel and avocado. Our Scallion cream cheese is a popular choice, or if you'd like something a bit more classic, our Plain cream cheese is

[2025-06-23T01:35:35.816Z] Customer: Do you have cedars, please?
