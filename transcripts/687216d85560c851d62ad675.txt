[2025-07-12T08:10:59.910Z] AI Agent: The price of the Breakfast Bundle is $29.99. This includes 13 bagels, 2 tubs of cream cheese, and 4 muffins. So, the total cost of the Breakfast Bundle is $29.99. Then, I added the

[2025-07-12T08:10:59.910Z] Customer: Then why did then why did you calculate differently?

[2025-07-12T08:11:00.826Z] Unknown: [2025-07-12T08:10:59.910Z] assistant: I made an error in my previous calculations. The correct total price should be based on the price of the Breakfast Bundle, which is $29.99. 

To calculate the total price, I should have started with the base price of the Breakfast Bundle, which is $29.99. Then, I should have added any additional costs, such as taxes. 

The tax rate is 9.98%, so I would multiply the base price by the tax rate to get the tax amount: $29.99 x 0.0998 = $2.99. 

Then, I would add the tax amount to the base price to get the total price: $29.99 + $2.99 = $32.98.

So, the correct total price is $32.98. I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous mistake.
