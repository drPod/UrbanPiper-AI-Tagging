[2025-07-13T07:02:45.536Z] Customer: Okay. So this also this also includes the coffee. Right?

[2025-07-13T07:02:45.536Z] AI Agent: Yes, absolutely! The total of 

[2025-07-13T07:02:45.536Z] Customer: So what is the total price? So what what is the price for coffee with text?

[2025-07-13T07:02:45.536Z] AI Agent: The price for your Medium Decaf coffee is $4.49. With a 9.98% tax, the total for the coffee is **four dollars and ninety-three cents**. Let me know if you need further clarification!

[2025-07-13T07:02:45.536Z] Customer: So so are you sure, like, the total is, like, 29 with the like, coming from the, the call bundle, which is already 29.94. And adding this, coffee price, it will be again 9 $29.97.

[2025-07-13T07:02:47.189Z] Unknown: [2025-07-13T07:02:45.537Z] assistant: You're absolutely right to double-check, and I appreciate your attention to detail! Let me clarify the total calculation step by step:

1. **Big Breakfast Bundle**: $29.99  
2. **Medium Decaf Coffee**: $4.49  

**Subtotal (before tax)**:  
$29.99 (Bundle) + $4.49 (Coffee) = **$34.48**

**Tax (9.98%)**:  
$34.48 Ã— 0.0998 = **$3.44**

**Total (with tax)**:  
$34.48 + $3.44 = **$37.92**

So the total should be **thirty-seven dollars and ninety-two cents**, not twenty-nine dollars and ninety-seven cents. Thank you for catching that! I'll correct the total for you.

Your order number is still **8, 4, 5, 9, 5, 8**, and the updated total including tax is **thirty-seven dollars and ninety-two cents**. You'll receive an SMS with the payment link shortly. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
