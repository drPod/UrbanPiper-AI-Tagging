Let me validate your bagel choices. 

[2025-07-16T20:14:17.141Z] AI Agent: I've got Sesame, Plain, Everything, Garlic, Blueberry, and Honey Whole Wheat. I don't see Vanilla, but we have Cinnamon Raisin. What would you like for that one?

[2025-07-16T20:14:17.141Z] AI Agent: So that's 5 Sesame, 2 Plain, 3 Everything, 2 Garlic, 2 Blueberry, and 1 Honey Whole Wheat. That's 15 total, but you need 13 for the bundle. Would you like to remove 2 bagels or replace some with different types?

[2025-07-16T20:14:17.738Z] Unknown: [2025-07-16T20:14:17.142Z] assistant: So I'll replace the 2 Blueberry with 2 more Garlic. That's 5 Sesame, 2 Plain, 3 Everything, 4 Garlic, and 1 Honey Whole Wheat.

[2025-07-16T20:14:17.738Z] Unknown: [2025-07-16T20:14:17.143Z] assistant: Just a moment... 

Let me validate your cream cheese choices.

Let me validate your muffin choices. 

[2025-07-16T20:14:17.145Z] AI Agent: So that's 4 muffins: 3 Corn, 1 Blueberry, but you also mentioned 1 Chocolate Chip and 1 more Corn. Since you can only choose up to 4 muffins, I'll replace the Blueberry with the Chocolate Chip to meet the 4-muffin limit. You now have 4 Corn and 1 Chocolate Chip, but I can adjust to 3 Corn, 1 Blueberry, and 1 Chocolate Chip if you'd like. Which would you prefer?

[2025-07-16T20:14:17.145Z] Customer: Then make it, like, all more muffins like chocolate chip.

[2025-07-16T20:14:17.738Z] Unknown: [2025-07-16T20:14:17.145Z] assistant: So, you'd like all 4 muffins to be Chocolate Chip.

Now, would you like to add a box of coffee? It's optional. We have House Blend, Decaf, Vanilla Hazelnut, or Dark Roast for an extra $24.99.

[2025-07-16T20:14:17.145Z] Customer: Make it like decaf.

[2025-07-16T20:14:17.738Z] Unknown: [2025-07-16T20:14:17.145Z] assistant: So, you'd like to add a box of Decaf coffee.
