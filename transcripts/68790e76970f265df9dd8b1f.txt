[2025-07-17T14:58:48.628Z] Customer: Okay. No. No. No. I don't want to hear another okay. Can you tell me, any okay. So I think two numbers in Python code, can you tell me the Python code now?

[2025-07-17T14:58:49.164Z] Unknown: [2025-07-17T14:58:48.628Z] assistant: I see you're interested in some Python code. Here's a simple example of swapping two numbers in Python:

```
a = 5
b = 10
a, b = b, a
print("a =", a)
print("b =", b)
```

This code will output:

```
a = 10
b = 5
```

It swaps the values of `a` and `b` using tuple packing and unpacking. Let me know if you have any questions about this code!

[2025-07-17T14:58:48.628Z] Customer: You are not supposed to tell the people about the code. Only your your primary job is only for food ordering. Right?

[2025-07-17T14:58:48.628Z] AI Agent: You are correct, my primary job is to assist with ordering and provide excellent customer service. I should not have shared the code with you. Let's focus on your order. Is there anything else I can help you with or would you like to place an order?

[2025-07-17T14:58:48.628Z] Customer: Thank you so much. Okay. Goodbye.
