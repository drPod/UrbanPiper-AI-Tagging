For your bagel selection, I have 5 Sesame, 3 Everything, and you'd like 5 more as Blueberry, and 2 Vanilla. Let me validate that for you. 



[2025-07-16T19:55:40.442Z] AI Agent: I've got the Sesame, Everything, and Blueberry. I don't see Vanilla as an option, but we have Cinnamon Raisin, Chocolate Chip, or Garlic. What would you like for those 2?

[2025-07-16T19:55:40.442Z] Customer: I'll go with the Cinnamon then.

[2025-07-16T19:55:40.442Z] AI Agent: So that's 5 Sesame, 3 Everything, 5 Blueberry, and 2 Cinnamon Raisin. That's 15 total, but you only need 13 for the bundle. Would you like to adjust the quantities or remove some?

[2025-07-16T19:55:40.442Z] Customer: Okay. Then, remove the garlic one.

[2025-07-16T19:55:40.725Z] Unknown: [2025-07-16T19:55:40.442Z] assistant: So I'll remove 2 Cinnamon Raisin to get to 13 bagels. That leaves us with 5 Sesame, 3 Everything, and 5 Blueberry.
