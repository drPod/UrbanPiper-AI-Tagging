Now, let me just confirm your entire order.

For the spreads, you've selected 1 Plain Cream Cheese and 1 Strawberry Cream Cheese. For the muffins, you've chosen 2 Blueberry and 2 Corn. And finally, you've added a box of House Blend coffee.

Before I place your order, do you have any special requests or allergies I should note for the kitchen?

[2025-06-23T17:07:45.352Z] Unknown: [2025-06-23T17:07:44.561Z] assistant: Let me calculate your total.

The Breakfast Bundle is $29.99. You've added a box of House Blend coffee for $24.99. So, your subtotal is $29.99 + $24.99 = $54.98. 

I will now calculate tax on your subtotal.
