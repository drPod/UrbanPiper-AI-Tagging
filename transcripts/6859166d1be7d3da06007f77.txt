[2025-06-23T08:56:56.930Z] Customer: I want all of 13 as garlic bagel.

[2025-06-23T08:56:57.120Z] Unknown: [2025-06-23T08:56:56.930Z] assistant: You'd like all 13 bagels to be Garlic. That's a great choice. 

Next, for the Choose 2 Tubs of Spread, we have options like Plain Cream Cheese, Vegetable Cream Cheese, and more. You need to choose exactly 2 tubs of spread. Which two would you like?

[2025-06-23T08:56:56.930Z] Customer: Vanilla and, vegetable.

[2025-06-23T08:56:56.930Z] AI Agent: You've chosen Vanilla and Vegetable Cream Cheese as your two tubs of spread. Moving on to the Choose 4 Muffins, we have options like Blueberry, Corn, Double Chocolate, and more. You can choose

[2025-06-23T08:56:56.931Z] Customer: 

[2025-06-23T08:56:56.931Z] AI Agent: Vanilla is not a valid option for the cream cheese spreads. You had chosen Vanilla and Vegetable earlier, but since Vanilla is not available, let's replace it with a different option. How about Plain Cream Cheese or Scallion/Onion Chive instead?

[2025-06-23T08:56:56.931Z] Customer: Then why are you proceeding?
