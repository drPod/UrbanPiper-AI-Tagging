[2025-07-17T19:35:51.086Z] AI Agent: Hello Darsh Welcome to manhattan bagel It is great to see you again What would you like to order?

[2025-07-17T19:35:51.087Z] Customer: Can I get an avocado BLT sandwich?

[2025-07-17T19:35:51.088Z] AI Agent: That would be our Avocado BLT Sandwich on the menu. I'll add that for you. Now, let's customize it. You mentioned Avocado BLT, which comes with turkey-bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and roasted tomato spread on a thintastic bagel. Would you like to make any changes to that or add any cheese?

[2025-07-17T19:35:51.088Z] Customer: Yeah. Can you add some avocado, spinach, cucumber, green peppers, roasted red peppers, grilled yellow onions, jalapeno peppers, capers, lettuce, tomato, onions, and remove the bacon?

[2025-07-17T19:35:51.089Z] AI Agent: For your Avocado BLT Sandwich, I can definitely add some extra avocado, spinach, cucumber, green peppers, roasted red peppers, grilled yellow onions, jalapeno peppers, and capers. I'll also remove the bacon for you. Just to confirm, you'd like to keep the lettuce, tomato, and onion that already come on the sandwich, correct? And would you like to toast your thintastic bagel or keep it as is?

[2025-07-17T19:35:51.089Z] Customer: Yeah. Can you test it?

[2025-07-17T19:35:51.090Z] AI Agent: I'll add that your thintastic bagel should be toasted. Now, let me just confirm your order. You've got an Avocado BLT Sandwich with extra avocado, spinach, cucumber, green peppers, roasted red peppers, grilled yellow onions, jalapeno peppers, capers, lettuce, tomato, and onion, without bacon, on a toasted thintastic bagel. Is that all for you today?

[2025-07-17T19:35:51.090Z] Customer: Actually, remove the avocado and add pepper jack cheese.

[2025-07-17T19:35:51.091Z] AI Agent: For your Avocado BLT Sandwich, I'll remove the avocado since it's already part of the sandwich name but you want it removed, and I'll add pepper jack cheese for you. Just to recap, your modified Avocado BLT Sandwich will have spinach, cucumber, green peppers, roasted red peppers, grilled yellow onions, jalapeno peppers, capers, lettuce, tomato, onion, and pepper jack cheese, without bacon, on a toasted thintastic bagel. Is that correct?

[2025-07-17T19:35:51.091Z] Customer: Yep.
