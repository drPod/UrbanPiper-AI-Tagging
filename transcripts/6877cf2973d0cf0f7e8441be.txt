[2025-07-16T16:16:09.942Z] AI Agent: Hello Jitin Welcome to manhattan bagel It is great to see you again What would you like to order?

[2025-07-16T16:16:09.943Z] Customer: I I want, breakfast bundle and hot coffee.

[2025-07-16T16:16:09.943Z] AI Agent: The Breakfast Bundle includes 13 fresh-baked Manhattan Bagels, 2 tubs of cream cheese, 4 muffins, and a box of coffee. For the hot coffee, I have a few options. Would you like House Blend, Decaf, Vanilla Hazelnut Blend, or Dark Roast?

[2025-07-16T16:16:09.943Z] Customer: First, I want to go with the breakfast bundle.

[2025-07-16T16:16:09.943Z] AI Agent: For the Breakfast Bundle, you'll need to choose 13 bagels. I have Plain, Everything, Sesame, and Blueberry. Would you like to start with one of these, or would you like to hear more options?

[2025-07-16T16:16:09.944Z] Customer: Okay. I will go with the five SMA, two plain, seven, blueberry, and three vanilla.

[2025-07-16T16:16:09.944Z] AI Agent: For the bagels, you've chosen 5 Sesame, 2 Plain, 7 Blueberry, but I need to let you know that Vanilla is not a standard bagel option. We do have a Vanilla Hazelnut Blend for our coffee, but for bagels, we have a variety of other flavors. Would you like to replace the 3 Vanilla bagels with another option, such as Everything, Cinnamon Raisin, or Multigrain?

[2025-07-16T16:16:09.944Z] Customer: Okay. Then do the do replay with the multigrade.

[2025-07-16T16:16:10.601Z] Unknown: [2025-07-16T16:16:09.944Z] assistant: So, to confirm, you'd like to replace the 3 Vanilla bagels with 3 Multigrain bagels. That gives us a total of 5 Sesame, 2 Plain, 7 Blueberry, and 3 Multigrain bagels.

Next, for the 2 tubs of cream cheese, would you like to choose from our options like Plain Cream Cheese, Vegetable Cream Cheese, or Scallion Cream Cheese?

[2025-07-16T16:16:09.944Z] Customer: Yeah. Give me blueberry and, strawberry.

[2025-07-16T16:16:10.601Z] Unknown: [2025-07-16T16:16:09.945Z] assistant: For the 2 tubs of cream cheese, you've chosen Blueberry and Strawberry. 

Next, for the 4 muffins, would you like to choose from our options like Blueberry, Corn, Double Chocolate, or Cinnamon Chip?

[2025-07-16T16:16:09.945Z] Customer: Give me four corn and two, double chocolate.

[2025-07-16T16:16:09.945Z] AI Agent: For the muffins, you've chosen 4 Corn and 2 Double Chocolate. However, I need to let you know that the Breakfast Bundle comes with 4 muffins, so you can only choose 4 muffins in total. Would you like to replace the 2 Double Chocolate muffins with 2 more Corn muffins, or choose 2 different types of muffins to add to the 2 Corn muffins?

[2025-07-16T16:16:09.945Z] Customer: Okay. Do that.

[2025-07-16T16:16:10.601Z] Unknown: [2025-07-16T16:16:09.945Z] assistant: So, to confirm, you'd like to have 4 Corn muffins and 0 Double Chocolate muffins, since the bundle only comes with 4 muffins.

Now, let's review your Breakfast Bundle: you have 5 Sesame bagels, 2 Plain bagels, 7 Blueberry bagels, and 3 Multigrain bagels. For the cream cheese, you've chosen Blueberry and Strawberry. And for the muffins, you've chosen 4 Corn muffins.

Next, would you like to add a box of coffee to your Breakfast Bundle? We have House Blend, Decaf, Vanilla Hazelnut Blend, or Dark Roast.
