[2025-06-21T20:45:26.077Z] AI Agent: Hello there, Welcome to Manhattan Bagel, I'm BagelBot, a friendly voice AI, and How can I assist you today?

[2025-06-21T20:45:26.077Z] Customer: Hey. Hi. I'd like to make an order.

[2025-06-21T20:45:26.077Z] AI Agent: That sounds great. To get started, could you please tell me what you'd like to order today? We have a wide variety of bagels, sandwiches, and other delicious items on our menu.

[2025-06-21T20:45:26.078Z] Customer: Okay. So I'd like to order, iced tea.

[2025-06-21T20:45:26.078Z] AI Agent: Our ice tea is a refreshing choice. Let me get the options for your ice tea... 

[2025-06-21T20:45:26.078Z] AI Agent: For your ice tea, we have a few options to customize it to your taste. Let's start with the size. We have small, which is 16 ounces, medium, which is 24 ounces, and large, which is 32 ounces. Which size sounds good to you?

[2025-06-21T20:45:26.079Z] Customer: A medium size.

[2025-06-21T20:45:26.079Z] AI Agent: A medium size is 24 ounces. Now, let's talk about the type of milk you'd like in your ice tea. We have regular milk, half and half, skim milk, almond milk, oat milk, and soy milk. Which one would you prefer?

[2025-06-21T20:45:26.079Z] Customer: But milk is not required in iced tea. Right?

[2025-06-21T20:45:26.079Z] AI Agent: Milk is not typically added to ice tea, so let's move on to the next option. We have a variety of sweeteners and syrups you can add to your ice tea, such as sugar, sweet and low, equal, splenda, raw sugar, and several flavored syrups like pumpkin, caramel, and hazelnut. Would you like to add any of these to your ice tea?
