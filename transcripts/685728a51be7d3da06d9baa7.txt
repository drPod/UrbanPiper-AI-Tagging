[2025-06-21T21:52:01.905Z] Customer: But that doesn't mean like, I I wanted unsweet nicely. Right?

[2025-06-21T21:52:01.905Z] AI Agent: I made an assumption earlier. When you said "I don't need milk in this iced tea, that's not possible, actually", I should have asked for clarification, but instead, I moved forward with the order. To confirm, you did not explicitly say "unsweetened iced tea", but rather mentioned that you didn't want milk in your iced tea. If you'd like to make any changes or corrections to your order, please let me know!
